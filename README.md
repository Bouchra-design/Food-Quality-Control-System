# 🧪 Food Quality Control System

## 📘 Project Description
This collaborative project simulates a simplified **food quality control workflow** for a small-scale processing unit or laboratory.  
It aims to demonstrate the main stages of quality assurance, including **sample collection, testing, data recording**, and **decision-making** regarding product conformity.  
The project also serves as a hands-on introduction to **collaborative version control using GitHub**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify and document the main steps and criteria of a QC (Quality Control) process.  
- Collect and record example data in a CSV file.  
- Practice **team collaboration** using GitHub features (README, Project Board, and Collaborators).  
- Produce a **concise final report** summarizing test results and improvement recommendations.

## 🧩 Steps of Realization
1. **Sample collection and labeling** — identification of samples and preparation for testing.  
2. **Physical and chemical analyses** — temperature, pH, moisture, and other quality indicators.  
3. **Microbiological screening** — performed if laboratory resources are available.  
4. **Results recording** — classification of samples as *Conform* or *Non-Conform*.  
5. **Final report preparation** — data summary, observations, and recommendations.
