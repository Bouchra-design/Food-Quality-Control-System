# 🧪 Food Quality Control System

## 📘 Project Description
This project simulates a simple food quality control workflow for a small processing unit or laboratory. It demonstrates sample collection, testing, recording, and decision-making about product conformity.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Document QC steps and criteria
- Collect sample data and store it in a CSV
- Show collaboration using GitHub (README, Project Board, Collaborators)
- Produce a short final report summarizing results and recommendations

## 🧩 Steps of realization
1. Sample collection and labeling
2. Physical and chemical tests (temperature, pH, moisture)
3. Microbiological screening (if available)
4. Recording results and classifying Conform / Non-conform
5. Final report and recommendations
